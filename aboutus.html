<p>CossiePlay is a family run business. They create outstanding custom made costumes. People who cosplay can order any type of costume (from a simple Spiderman or elf costume to advanced features such as armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields).Depending on the difficulty, costumes can take between 1 and 50 weeks, and cost between $10 and $10,000.<br>
<br>
We buy and sell second-hand costumes. On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing (but you do not have to dance if you do not want to).

<p>Peopole who attend the CossiePlay parties do so at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. The party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS is accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge.<br> Alcohol will be served at the bar to over 18's only. No intoxicated people will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi (paid by the party-goer).
